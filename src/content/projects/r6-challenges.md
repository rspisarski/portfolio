R6 Challenges is a dynamic web application built with Next.js and Supabase, designed specifically for the Rainbow Six Siege gaming community. The platform enables users to create, share, and track custom in-game challenges, leveraging Supabase's real-time database capabilities for efficient data storage and retrieval. The application features a robust user authentication system implemented with JWT tokens, ensuring secure session management and personalized user experiences.

The frontend is developed using Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI components, while Next.js's API routes handle backend operations including challenge creation, user authentication, and data fetching. The platform supports user-generated content, allowing players to design and share their own challenges with the community. Each challenge is stored in a structured Supabase PostgreSQL database, with relationships between users, challenges, and completions carefully managed for optimal performance.

Targeted primarily at the Twitch streaming community, R6 Challenges provides streamers with an interactive tool to engage their audience during live broadcasts. The application's real-time features, powered by Supabase's subscription capabilities, allow for instant updates when challenges are completed or new ones are created. This integration with the streaming ecosystem has made it a popular tool for enhancing viewer interaction and creating unique gaming experiences.
