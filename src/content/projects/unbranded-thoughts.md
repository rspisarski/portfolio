Unbranded Thoughts is a sophisticated personal web blog built on a modern tech stack featuring Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, Supabase for backend services, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. The application is deployed on Vercel, leveraging its edge network for optimal global performance. The platform features a custom-built CMS that allows for seamless content management and editorial workflows.

The backend architecture integrates with the Claude API to generate AI-powered blog posts, with a unique system that maintains distinct writing styles for each author. This is achieved through carefully crafted prompt engineering and style templates stored in Supabase's PostgreSQL database. The AI generates content based on detailed watch specifications, combining technical analysis with personalized commentary to create engaging and informative articles.

The frontend implementation utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, including the @tailwindcss/typography plugin for beautiful, readable content presentation. The application features dynamic routing with Next.js, enabling efficient content delivery and SEO optimization. User authentication is handled through Supabase's built-in auth system, allowing for secure access control and personalized experiences.
