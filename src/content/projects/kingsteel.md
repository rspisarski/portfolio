As the developer behind hogrings.com, I created a robust e-commerce solution for King Steel Fasteners, a Michigan-based manufacturer and global supplier of industrial fastening systems established in 1995. The company required a digital platform that would showcase their extensive product line while maintaining their reputation for customer satisfaction and quality American-made products.

I built a custom WordPress theme from the ground up, implementing Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to create a flexible content management system that allows their team to easily update product specifications, applications, and industry-specific content. The WooCommerce integration handles their complex product catalog with multiple filtering options including series, materials, dimensions, and tool models, enabling customers to quickly find specific fasteners among hundreds of SKUs.

The site architecture features dedicated sections for product categories, quote requests, and company information, with a responsive design that translates their brand's industrial reliability to the digital space. Custom post types were implemented to organize their diverse product line logically, while the checkout process was streamlined for both individual purchases and quote-based ordering for large volume clients.

I also developed specialized content templates to showcase application-specific information, such as comparative product guides that help customers choose between different tool options like pneumatic guns versus manual pliers. King Steel Fasteners The custom theme respects King Steel's brand identity while delivering a modern user experience that serves both industry professionals and DIY customers alike."
