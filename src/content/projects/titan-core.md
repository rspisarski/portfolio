## Project Overview

Titan Core is the foundational theme system I developed for Titan Studio Themes, a specialized Astro JS theme company. This core framework serves as both a standalone minimalist theme and the architectural foundation for our entire theme ecosystem, including upcoming Agency, Portfolio, Recipe, Design, Blog, Resume, and Marketing releases.

## Technical Accomplishments

I architected Titan Core with a modular component system that prioritizes:

- Performance optimization achieving 100/100 Lighthouse scores
- Accessible design meeting WCAG AA standards
- Responsive layouts using a flexible grid system
- Minimal JavaScript footprint through Astro's island architecture
- Comprehensive design token system for consistent styling
- Content-focused architecture with flexible collection schemas

## Development Approach

My development process focused on creating a scalable system rather than just a theme. I implemented a component inheritance model that allows specialized themes to extend core functionality while maintaining consistency across the Titan ecosystem.
The modular architecture enables rapid development of new theme variants while ensuring that improvements to the core propagate throughout all derived themes, significantly reducing maintenance overhead.
