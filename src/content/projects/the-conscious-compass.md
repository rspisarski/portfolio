The Conscious Compass is a full-stack web application built with Next.js and Supabase, designed as a sophisticated sales assessment tool for Antenna Group. The application leverages server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities of Next.js to deliver optimal performance, while Supabase provides the backend infrastructure including authentication, database management, and real-time updates.

The system implements a multi-stage assessment process that evaluates potential clients' compatibility with Antenna Group's services. User sessions are managed through secure JWT tokens, allowing users to save and resume their progress. The application features a custom-built assessment engine that dynamically adapts questions based on user responses, ensuring precise qualification analysis.

Integration with Smartsheet's API enables real-time tracking of client progress and automated data synchronization between the assessment platform and Antenna Group's CRM workflows. The frontend utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive design and GSAP for smooth animations, creating an engaging user experience while maintaining technical efficiency.
